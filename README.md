### hi there 👋 

i currently run an independent research lab called qinārā ai. i previously worked as an associate lecturer at the ual creative computing institute, where i facilitated lab sessions and code walkthroughs for the msc data science & ai for the creative industries + ma/msc computing & creative industry programmes.

my practice focuses on building creative ml models, and examining how it can be used to empower marginalised communities; while also critically interrogating the hegemonic power structures embedded within technological systems.

outside of work, i enjoy reading philosophy, curating endless playlists, photographing beautiful places and people, and writing poetry. feel free to get in touch if you would like to discuss a project, or just have a chat.

👯 i’m looking to collaborate on: exploring techno-orientalism in science fiction films
