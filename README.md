### Hi there 👋 

I currently run an independent research lab called Qinārā AI. I previously worked as an Associate Lecturer at the UAL Creative Computing Institute, where I facilitated lab sessions and code walkthroughs for the MSc Data Science and AI for the Creative Industries programme.

My practice focuses on examining how technology shapes the world we live in, and how it can be used to empower marginalised communities; while also critically interrogating the hegemonic power structures embedded within technological systems.

Outside of work, I enjoy reading philosophy, curating endless playlists, photographing beautiful places and people, and writing poetry. Feel free to get in touch if you would like to discuss a project, or just have a chat.

🔭 I’m currently working on: redesigning healthcare services for learning disabled and autistic people

🌱 I’m currently learning: p5.js for generative art

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on: exploring techno-orientalism in science fiction films
